# Regular expression used to be processed by REname

# To get basic notions in Regular expressions: https://regexone.com/
# More about regular expression: https://www.regular-expressions.info/tutorial.html

# Each section behaves as a processing unit applied on the compound name.
# Every section contains two parameters:
    # regex = Regular expression applied to the compound name
    # replace = Characters that will replace the string "captured" by regex
